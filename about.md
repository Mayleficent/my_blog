	<h1 class="pageTitle">Welcome to my blog</h1>
		<p class="intro">My name is Moyhour Ang, I am a self-taught web developer.</p>
		<p> I was born and raised in Cambodia. I have never had any experience in web development before, fortunately three years ago when I met my husband, he introduced me to it and I enjoyed it so much that I want to make a career of out it.</p>
	  <p> I started by learning Photoshop, HTML, and CSS. After that, I learned how to use framework like Bootstrap and WordPress. And now I start learning JavaScript and PHP. I am not an expert in everything I have learned yet, that is one of the reasons why I am creating this blog.</p>
		<p> My purpose of writing this blog is to help myself to improve my skills and also share the problems and solutions that I have encountered while learning and working on projects.</p>
