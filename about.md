	<h1 class="pageTitle">Welcome to my blog</h1>
		<p class="intro">My name is Moyhour Ang, I am a self-taught web developer.</p>
		<p> I was born and raised in Cambodia. I have never had any experience in web development before, fortunately three years ago when I met my husband in Canada, he introduced me to it and I enjoyed it so much that I want to make a career of out it.</p>
	  <p> I started by learning Photoshop, and now I have a diverse set of skills ranging from design to HTML5, CSS3, SASS, Javascript, all the way to PHP and MySQL. I also have experience in Bootstrap 3 as well as WordPress.</p>
		<p> My purpose of writing this blog is to help myself to improve my skills and also share the problems and solutions that I have encountered while learning and working on projects.</p>
