	<h1 class="pageTitle">Welcome to my blog</h1>
		<p class="intro">My name is Moyhour Ang, I am a self-taught front-end web developer.</p>
		<p> I was born and raised in Cambodia, I have completed my bachelor degree in English for Communication at Institute of Foreign Languages(IFL). Three years ago, I have known nothing about computer especially web development. Fortunately, I had a chance to study in Canada where I have found my passion as a web developer. I first started teaching myself Photoshop and later I studied HTML and CSS. The more I learn about web development, the more I fall in love with it. I am telling myself that one day I really want to be a web developer. After that I took web development even more seriously that I started to learn javascript, sass, and now I am on my way to learn php.</p>
		<p> My purpose of writing this blog is to share my experience and techniques to other self-taught web developer out there.</p>
